# Git intro

Git is a **distributed version control system** 
that tracks changes in any set of computer files, 
usually used for coordinating work among programmers 
collaboratively developing source code during software
development. Its goals include speed, data integrity,
and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

<br />
Git saves only the changes made after the previous 
update, this way saving space.

Older versions would save all the changes and all the
previous work again.

Useful git commands:
1. **git init** - initialises git
2. **git status** - displays any new changes made and
if they were added
3. **git add** - adds the changes, but doesn't commit them
4. **git commit** - committing the changes added, adding useful
and descriptive message using -m
5. **ls** - list of files in the current directory
6. **log** - list of changes committed with their authors
